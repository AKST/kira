# Contributing

Happy to accept contribution. The easiest way to get a PR approved
by me is to do the following. *If you're unsure on any of these I'd
still encourage you to submit your PR, and I'll just mention any
changes necessary in the PR* ðŸ˜„

- Consistent styles
- Some form of types for new functions or data structure
- For public functions, some form of doc string is recommended
- Some form of tests
  - For bug fixes just a test or tests to prevent any regresion
  - For features, just a test to prove it works as described

For any non trival change I'd recommended reaching out, the easiest
way to find me is on twitter [@ANGUS_KST][twitter] or via [email][email].
